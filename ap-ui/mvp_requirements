2. Performance Data
Total number of questions attempted
Total number of correct answers
Total number of mistakes
Accuracy percentage over time (trend line)
Time taken to answer each question (to spot processing speed issues)
3. Mistake Analysis
Type of mistakes (Categorize into logical, calculation error, miscounting, misalignment, etc.)
Frequency of mistakes (e.g., repeated errors with addition, subtraction, etc.)
Common patterns (e.g., struggling with carrying, borrowing, multiplication tables)
Question difficulty level when mistakes are happening (e.g., easy, medium, hard)
Concept-based mistakes (e.g., trouble with fractions, number lines, word problems)
4. Session-Level Data
Date and time of each practice session
Number of questions per session
Improvement over sessions (graph showing progress)
5. Emotional and Behavioral Data (Optional but insightful)
Childâ€™s confidence level after answering (you can use a smiley face rating)
Frustration markers (e.g., increased mistakes over time could indicate fatigue)
Whether the child asked for help or tried independently
6. Diagnosis and Feedback
Send the mistake patterns and childâ€™s performance data to OpenAI to generate a probable diagnosis, such as:
Dyscalculia (if there are consistent calculation errors or misalignment)
Processing speed issues (if time taken to answer is very high)
Memory retrieval problems (if the child struggles to recall basic facts)
Attention issues (if there are inconsistent mistakes and careless errors)
Include a section for AI-generated suggestions like:
Focus more on multiplication facts
Try visual aids for fractions
Slow down to avoid rushing errors
