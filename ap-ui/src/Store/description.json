It stems from differences in how the brain processes language, not from a lack of intelligence or effort. People with dyslexia often have trouble recognizing letters, decoding words, and connecting sounds to letters. Although dyslexia is a lifelong condition, with the right strategies and support, individuals with dyslexia can achieve success in academics, careers, and everyday life."

          "content": "Dyslexia was first formally described in 1896 by British physician W. Pringle Morgan, who documented a case of a young boy with normal intelligence but severe reading difficulties. Early theories mistakenly linked dyslexia to vision problems, but research later showed that it is a language-based learning difference. Over the 20th century, understanding of dyslexia evolved significantly, leading to better diagnostic tools, teaching methods, and public awareness campaigns that emphasize early intervention and support."
